summary: Lists and concepts of some of my favorite commander decks
---

In this post I wanted to highlight my favorite commander decks and their current lists. I also wanted to say a little about how they play, were build and just some of my thoughts about them.

If I feel like it at some point I may write up a full primer when I get closer to a final finised list.

Note: I do play causual commander, most of my decks have limited tutors and only very jank 3+ card infinites if anything at all.

## Jeleva - The Classic

Jeleva has a special place in my heart, it was my first commander deck. I bought the preconstructed deck in 2016 at sentry box (LGS in Calgary). This is where all my expensive pulls and cool art goes. It has also been changed so many time because of how jank Jeleva's wording is. I had first started by changing the precon to huge funny spells cheated out from Jeleva. Then more top deck manipluation was added, eventually once I learned about doomsday as a card I had to put that in. Eventually I got bored of the doomsday line so it's current edition is a weird cast from exile value spell slinger with some copy effects.

Pros: Explosive, Interesting effects, Large Spells you don't often see, Grixis
Cons: Removal destroys the game plan, RNG can stop Jeleva's hits

## Toshiro - Consistency

Toshiro is one of the best decks in terms of how it almost always play well. It's strength is consistency and it is also super interesting card to build around. I don't have much to say other then this deck is sweet and one of my best that I have built from zero.

Pros: Spellslinger in a interesting colour, Lots of interaction, Consistent
Cons: Loses hard to non-creature decks and artifacts

## Kiyomaro - First to Stan

Kiyomaro is honestly one of those cards that I think 90% of commander players say `wtf` when I pull it out and I love that. This was originally a secret santa list and has made it in my top 3 for favorite decks. The entire deck basically evolves around drawing as many cards as possible and then swinging with a big old chonky boy. But what is fun about this deck is that you are doing that in mono-white a colour not know for its ability to draw. While it may not be the strongest deck it does do it's thing most of the time.

Pros: White card draw, Legendary no one knows, T-pose
Cons: Expensive to cast, Removal stops him hard
