summary: Lists and concepts of the decks I have with me in Japan
---

In this post I wanted to highlight the decks that I brought with me to Japan in there current lists. I also wanted to say a little about how they play, were build and just some of my thoughts about them.

I do play causual commander, most of my decks have limited tutors and only very jank 3+ card infinites if anything.

## Jeleva - The Classic

Jeleva has a speical place in my heart, it was the first commander that I had back in 2016. Bought it from the 2013 preconstructed decks at sentry box when $2 for a card was insane to me. This is where all my cool pull and expensive shit goes. It has also been changed so many time because of how jank this commander is. First it was just huge funny spells hoping to be able to be cast from Jeleva. Then more top deck manipluation was added, eventually once I discovered doomsday as a card I had to put that in. Eventually I got bored of the doomsday line so it's current edition is a weird cast from exile value spell slinger with some copy effects.

## Toshiro - Consistency

Toshiro is one of the best decks in terms of how it almost always play well. It's strength is consistency and it is also super interesting card to build around. I don't have much to say other then this deck is sweet and one of my best.

## Kiyomaro - First to Stan

Kiyomaro is honestly one of those cards that I think 90% of commander players say `wtf` when I pull it out and I love that. James, built this for me for our secret santa in 2021 and has made it in my top 3 for favorite decks. The entire deck basically evolves around drawing as many cards as possible and then swinging with a big old chonky boy. But what is fun about this deck is that you are doing that in mono-white a colour not know for its ability to draw.
