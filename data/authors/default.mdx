I am Australian/Canadian a masters student of computer science and communication engineering at Waseda Universtiy. I am a part of [Network Security Lab](https://nsl.cs.waseda.ac.jp/), where I am interested in Internet Measurement, Privacy and User aspects of software.

I am currently working on my masters research about VPNs, it's users adoption and misconecptions surrounding it as a tool. I also currently work part time as a research assistance at NICT and as a assistant coach at Spolish Gym. When I am not studying or working I spend time playing card games, cycling or skiing.

After my planned graduation in September 2024 I hope to find a job in Game Development or Network Security. If you are interested in working with me please reach out on linkedin or by email.
