I am Australian/Canadian a masters student of computer science and communication engineering at Waseda Universtiy. I am a part of Network Security Lab, where I am interested in Internet Measurement, Privacy and User aspects of software.

I am currently working on my masters research about VPNs, it's users adoption and misconecptions surrounding it as a tool. I also work part time at Spolish Gym coaching and teaching english to youth between the ages 1-5. When I am not studying or working I spend time playing card games, cycling or skiing.

After my planned graduation in September 2024 I hope to find a job in Game Development or Network Security. If you are interested in working with me please reach out on linkedin or by email.
