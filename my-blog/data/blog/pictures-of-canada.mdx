# しまなみ海道

The Shimanami Kaido is a 75km National cycling route between Hiroshima and Ehime prefectures. More spefically it goes between the cities of Onomichi and Imabari. The route is made up of 6 different islands connected by 7 bridges crossing over the Seto Sea.

Because I had 3 days to explore (March 21st to 24th), I ended up cycled over 200kms while exploring all the side paths I could. Personally I would 100% reccomend this as a must do in Japan, currently my favorite thing I have done here while travelling the country.

# Day 1

I took the bullet train from Tokyo Station to Shin-Onomichi Station, with a transfer at Okayama Station. After assembling my bike I got to my hostel around ~10pm. I did spend more time then I thought I would fiddeling with my back tire.

Stayed at [Guesthouse Yadocurly](https://www.facebook.com/yadocurly/), owner was nice and willing to stay late to let me check in. 

After checking in I walked to the main stations, grabbed some combini dinner before heading to bed. Guy below me did snore like an absolute beast, earbuds came in clutch...

# Day 2

Started early, about 7:30, as the hostel room got rather loud in the morning. Was planning on getting some food on the first island but nothing was open due to the time.

Didnt end up deviating from the main route on the first island and went through it very relaxed. Although on the second island I almost went to a side path right away.
